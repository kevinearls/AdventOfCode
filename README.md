# Advent of Code 2017
See http://adventofcode.com/2017

This project contains my work for the Advent Of Code 2017.  In general the solutions are the
most straightforward I could come up with.  The just get the job done.  

This is not necessarily my best work.  If this was something I was doing for my job I would
probably spend more time cleaning up and refactoring, checking for bad input, etc.
